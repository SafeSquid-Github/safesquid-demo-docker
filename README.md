# SafeSquid Demo

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SafeSquid-GitHub/safesquid-demo-docker.git
   cd safesquid-demo-docker
   ```

2. **Run the Applications:**

   - Start the applications using Docker Compose:

     ```bash
     docker compose up    # use the --build flag when running for the first time
     ```

   - Import the root certificate in your browser to access the applications over HTTPS. The root certificate is generated by Caddy and stored in the `caddy_data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt` file.

     - **Chrome:**

       - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://settings/security`.
       - Click on "Manage certificates".
       - Go to the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" tab and click on "Import".
       - Select the `root.crt` file from the `caddy_data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/` directory.
       - Click "Next" > "Next" > "Finish".

     - **Firefox:**

       - Open Firefox and go to `about:preferences#privacy`.
       - Scroll down to the "Certificates" section and click on "View Certificates".
       - Go to the "Authorities" tab and click on "Import".
       - Select the `root.crt` file from the `caddy_data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/` directory.
       - Check all the boxes and click "OK".

3. **Finally, Edit the Local DNS file:**

   - Add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` or (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` for Windows) file:

     ```
     # for csrf demo
     127.0.0.1 bankease.com
     127.0.0.1 hiking.com
     127.0.0.1 twitter.com

     # for phishing demo
     127.0.0.1 infinity.iciciibank.com
     127.0.0.1 infoman.com

     # for crypto-mining demo
     127.0.0.1 tictactoe.com

     # for malware
     127.0.0.1 code.vsstudio.com
     ```

**Note:** I recommend using Google Chrome for all simulations, as it tends to have minimal security restrictions by default, making it ideal for testing attack simulations.
